| Am   Dm   | G    C G/B |
| Am   Dm   | G    | Am       |

[Verse 1]
Am            Dm
   Talk to me softly
       G                  C    G/B
There's something in your eyes
Am                 Dm
   Don't hang your head in sorrow
G                  C   G/B
  And please don't cry

[Chorus]
F           G     Am
  Don't you cry tonight, I still love you baby
F           G     Am
  Don't you cry tonight
F           G     C                G/B     Am       G
  Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you baby
F               G     Am
  And don't you cry tonight

  I'm all at sea            Where no-one can bother me
C           Fmaj7  C         Fmaj7
  Forgot my roots    If only for a day

[Chorus 2]
D                      Am7
  Like a warm drink it seeps into my soul
Gmaj7                  Em7
  Please just leave me right here on my own
