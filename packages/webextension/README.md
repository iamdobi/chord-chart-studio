# (Highly experimental) web browser extension

This is a draft of a web browser extension to import chord charts from other websites into Chord Chart Studio.

Code quality is horrible and the extension is not published anywhere yet.
To run it, checkout the repository and [load the unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)

It has only been tested with Chrome.

It only "works" with Ultimate Guitar's chord charts.

You are welcome to help with improving this extension, I do not have the time to work on it currently.
