# Getting started

Welcome to <CM/> 5 minutes tutorial, where you will learn the basics of the format and its possibilities! 
To practice what you learn, head over to [Chord Charts Studio](/docs/chord-charts-studio/overview).

## Sample song

Let's have a look at a sample song, Hallelujah, by Leonard Cohen. 
You can switch between the source file, written in <CM/>, and the rendered version using the tabs.

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} />

## Breaking it down

Let's detail the chord chart above line by line.

### First verse

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} srcLines={'1'} renderLines={'1'} />

This is a section label that defines the start of a section: intro, verse, chorus...
The `#` is the section symbol; and `v` the shorthand notation for the label `Verse`.
<CM/> will automatically number the sections using the same label.

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} srcLines={'2-3'} renderLines={'2-3'} />

The first line contains two chords symbols followed by 2 dots each. This means that each chord should be played for 2 beats.
Since the default time signature is `4/4`, this line will be rendered as a single bar with 2 chords. 
The bar separators `|` are added automatically.

The second line contains the lyrics sung along with the chords above. The position marker symbol `_` is used to specify exactly where each chord should be played.

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} srcLines={'4-5'} renderLines={'4-5'} />

The symbol `%` instructs <CM/> to repeat the last defined chord line, eg line 2.

Although the chords are not defined explicitly but repeated, <CM/> still expects that two chords should be present in the lyric line. 

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} srcLines={'6-7'} renderLines={'6-7'} />

The first line declares 2 bars with 2 chords each.
Since the first bar has chords with uneven durations (3 beats for `F`, 1 beat for `G`), the beat count indicator `.` is explicitly rendered. 
It is omitted when each chord in a bar should be played for the same duration.

The second line contains only 3 chords position markers for 4 chords, since the last chord change happens after the lyrics end.
In that case, the position marker is optional and <CM/> simply appends the extra chord(s) at the end of the line.

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} srcLines={'12-13'} renderLines={'12-13'} />

When no duration is specified for a chord, like for the `Am` in the second bar here, then <CM/> understand that it should last the whole bar, e.g. 4 beats in that case.

### First chorus

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} srcLines={'15-23'} renderLines={'15-23'} />

`#c` declares a new section using the shorthand label `c` for `chorus`.
    
### Second verse

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} srcLines={'25-31'} renderLines={'25-37'} />

Now this is interesting: by using the `#v` section label a second time, we instruct <CM/> to automatically repeat the chords that have been defined for the first verse, and to apply them to the current section.
Which means that only the chords position markers are needed this time, and not the chord symbol themselves. 
This is a huge time saver when writing a chord chart!

Note that <CM/> automatically numbers the second verse.

### Second chorus

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} srcLines={'33'} renderLines={'39-47'} />

Since the second chorus is identical to the first one, we can just declare the label and leave the content of the section empty: <CM/> will understand that it should automatically repeat the whole section.

## Displaying a chord grid

Now let's say you are a bass player in a band and that only the chord grid matters to you. 
Easy peasy! <CM/> can automatically render a nicely formatted chord grid from the exact same source file:

<TabbedChordMark src={data.sampleSong} options={{chartType: 'chords'}}/>

## Going further

That's it! I hope you enjoyed this taster of <CM/> possibilities.
There is much more to discover, though.
As the next steps, we encourage you to start experimenting by yourself using the <CCS/> editor. 
You can also dive into the reference documentation to learn all about <CM/>.
