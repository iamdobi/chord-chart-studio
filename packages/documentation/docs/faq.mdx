# FAQ

## Where are my songs stored?

<CCS/> use the browser's memory (local storage) to store the songs. 
This has a huge advantage: since I don't need to pay for a server to store the user content, you can enjoy <CCS/> for free.
Of course, there are some drawbacks as well: if you switch computers, devices, or browsers, you will start with a blank library every time.

## Can I backup the songs library?

Not easily for now, but you can export each individual song.
Tech-savvy users can also directly access the local storage content and back it up, for example, in [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/localstorage/).

## Can I see the sample content again? 

When you start <CCS/> for the first time, it comes with two samples of "songs."
If you deleted them and would like to see them again, you can either:

- delete all the songs in the library and refresh the browser
- open <CCS/> in an incognito session or in another browser

## The layout is broken when printing

If the browser's printing preview looks different than <CCS/>'s preview, make sure:
- to set the document size as `A4`
- to disable the printer's margins, since they are directly handled by <CCS/>
