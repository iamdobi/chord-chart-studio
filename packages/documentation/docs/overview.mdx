# Overview

As the name says, <CCS /> is a tool to create and manage chord charts. 
It is web-based and can be [freely accessed online](http://chord-charts-studio.netlify.app).

Chord Charts Studio will allow you to:

- Create chords chart in the ChordMark format
- Multi-column layout, on screen or printed
- Transpose songs
- Harmonize chord accidentals
- Display the chords only (chord grid anyone?), the lyrics only, or both
- Format chords charts to be viewed on screen, printed, saved as PDF or exported as text files
- Import songs in ChordPro or Ultimate Guitar formats
- Exports songs in ChordMark or ChordPro format

## How to use?

I created <CCS /> because I needed a <CM /> editor for my personal transcriptions needs.

My typical workflow starts with [importing](/docs/import) lyrics or existing chords charts in various formats, such as ChordPro or Ultimate Guitar.
I then proceed with either transcribing the song myself if I only have the lyrics, or with adding the rhythm information if I start from an existing chord chart.
Finally, I format the chart for whichever support I want to use it:
 
- For printing, I use the **Print/PDF preview** module and use the formatting functionality to make sure it fits on a single page, two at the most.
- For use in the excellent [Mobile Sheet Pro](https://www.zubersoft.com/mobilesheets) on my phone, I use the **Export preview** module to create a ChordPro file that I can import in the application.

I also use <CCS /> as a repository for my songs; when I'm at home, I play by directly looking at my computer screen, taking advantage of the **Screen view** mode functionality.

If you are interested in knowing why I built <CCS /> instead of using existing tools, I invite you to read the story behind the [ChordMark](https://chordmark.netlify.app/docs/overview/story) format.

That's it, I hope you will have fun with <CCS />!
