# Sections

Sections are at the heart of some of <CM/> most powerful features, like the automatic repetition of chords across sections of the same type.
You can think of them as independent parts of a song such as Intro, Verse, Chorus, Solo...

Given the benefits they bring, it is highly recommended to systematically use section labels.

## Declaring a section

To create a new section, use the `#` character followed by a single word:

<TabbedChordMark src={'#intro\n#verse\n#bridge\n#chorus\n#verse\n#chorus'} />

Note that you should declare multiple sections of the same family with the exact same section label (eg `#verse`, `#chorus`...). <CM/> will automatically number them.

The section label should be a single word composed of only letters, uppercase or lowercase. 
If another character is present, such a space, then the line will be considered as a lyric line and no section will be declared.

<TabbedChordMark src={'Valid labels:\n#custom\n#mySection\n\nInvalid labels:\n#my section\n#1custom\n#custom 2'} />

To end a section, just declare a new one, or end the file:

<TabbedChordMark src={'#verse\nThis is the verse \n\n#chorus\nThis is the chorus'} />

## Shorthand notation

In order to speed up the writing process, <CM/> has a shorthand notation for the most commonly used sections names. 
Here is the list of all available shortcuts. It is highly encouraged to use them:

<TabbedChordMark src={'#a\n#b\n#c\n#i\n#o\n#p\n#s\n#u\n#v'} />

## Repeating chords

Now comes the juicy bits.
Once you specify the chords for a section, they are automatically repeated for the following sections declared with the exact same label.
Even if the chord lines are not there anymore, the chord position markers can be defined exactly as if the chords were explicitly written above.

<TabbedChordMark src={data.repeat1} />

If the chords differ a bit in a repeated section, just override them with a new chord line!
Overrides are only applied to the currently repeated section:

<TabbedChordMark src={data.repeat2} />

## Repeating a whole section

If a section is repeated with identical chords and lyrics, just write the label and leave the section body empty. 

<TabbedChordMark src={data.repeat3} />

By default, the first declared section with this label will be repeated. You can also target a specific one by appending its index to the label:

<TabbedChordMark src={data.repeat4} />

## Multiplying a section

If a section should be played multiple times in a row, just multiply it:

<TabbedChordMark src={'#c x2\nE7 D7\nA chorus played twice in a row'} options={{ expandSectionMultiply: false }} />

If <CM/> renderer is called with the `expandSectionMultiply: true` parameter, the multiplied sections will be explicitly repeated.

<TabbedChordMark src={'#c x2\nE7 D7\nA chorus played twice in a row\n'} options={{ expandSectionMultiply: true }} />

This works for repeated sections too.
