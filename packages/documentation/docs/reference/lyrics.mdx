# Writing lyrics

## Lyrics lines

Any line that is not a chord line is considered a lyric line, with a few exceptions such as time signature or section labels declarations.

<TabbedChordMark src={'A line with arbitrary content'} />

Lyrics lines do not exhibit any specific behavior except when they contain chord position markers. 

## Chord position markers

The `_` character can be used to specify where the chords of the immediately preceding chord line should be played.

<TabbedChordMark src={'Bm7.. E7.. A7\n_A lyric line _with positioned _chords\n\n%\n\n_Another one _without an immediatly preceding _chord line'} />

If the lyric line does not contain any position marker, then the chords are aligned with other chord lines:

<TabbedChordMark src={'A7 E7.. E7+..\nBm7.. E7.. A7\nA lyric line without positioned chords'} />

If the lyric line has more position markers than chords to position, then the extra ones are ignored. 
If it has less, then the remaining chords are displayed at the end of the line:

<TabbedChordMark src={'Bm7.. E7.. A7 Bm7.. E7.. A7\n_A _lyric _line _with _too _many _position _markers\n%\n_Another one _with too few _of them'} />

## Chords spawning multiple bars

This is one of the few cases where writing songs in <CM/> actually requires a bit of extra work compared to other formats.
If the _same_ chord is played over multiple bars, you will need to add a position marker for each one of those bars.
This (minimal) extra effort result in much better clarity on lyric placement, though.

<TabbedChordMark src={'A7 %%\nYou don\'t have to be _beautiful _ to turn me _on '} />
