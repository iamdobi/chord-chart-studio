# Chord Chart Studio

Chord Chart Studio is a tool to create, manage and format chord charts - e.g. song transcriptions made of chords and lyrics - for printing and viewing on screen. It can import and export songs from popular formats and websites, such as ChordPro and Ultimate Guitar.

Chord Chart Studio leverages the ChordMark format, which is the most powerful syntax to write chord charts.
