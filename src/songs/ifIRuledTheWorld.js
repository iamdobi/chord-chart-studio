If I ruled the world,
Every man would see the world was his friend. Yeah
There'd be happiness that no man could end,
No my friend, not if I ruled the world.
Every hand would be held up high,
There'd be sunshine in everyone's sky.
If the day ever dawned,
Will I rule the world.
Every hand would be held up high,
Every star would shine in everyone's sky.
If the day ever dawned,
Will I rule the world.`;
