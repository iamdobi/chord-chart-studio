<span class="lyrics-line">To turn me on</span>
I just need your body baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about
You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your
Kiss,
Oh oh
You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you want to impress me
You can't be to flirty, mama
I know how to undress me, yeah
I want to be your fantasy
Maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a good time
Don't have to be rich
To be my girl
Don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your
Kiss
Yes,â€¦

Ab.. Cm..

If I ruled the world,
Every day would be the first day of spring.
Every heart would have a new song to sing,
And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring.
If I ruled the world,
Every man would be as free as a bird.
Every voice would be a voice to be heard,
Take my word we would treasure each day that occurred.
My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams.
My world would wear a smile on its face,
Like the man and the moon has, when the moon beams.
If I ruled the world,
Every man would see the world was his friend. Yeah
There'd be happiness that no man could end,
No my friend, not if I ruled the world.
Every hand would be held up high,
There'd be sunshine in everyone's sky.
If the day ever dawned,
Will I rule the world.
Every hand would be held up high,
Every star would shine in everyone's sky.
If the day ever dawned,
Will I rule the world.
