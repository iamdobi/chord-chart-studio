# Tech debt
- SCSS individual imports
- abstract material icons in CSS with an icon class
- unit tests
- what to do with unknown options ? Don't display them if not in allWidgets
- have a clear entry point for each feature module
- remove old fileManager
- add id enricher middleware
- better encapsulation for icons in tests? Well anyway it will break on lib change because icons names are differents...
